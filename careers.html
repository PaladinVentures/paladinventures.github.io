    <h4>PAYMENT</h4>
    <p>
      Our internships are paid, however the payment structure varies by role. Payment is some form of commission or profit sharing for the business roles or fixed payment per completed assignment/project for design and engineering roles. Most of our internships for this summer are remote.

    <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
    <p>If you are looking to maximize earnings this summer, PV is most likely not the place for you. Given our portfolio is comprised of early stage startups, we are unable to offer the most competitive compensation packages. However, if your goal is to maximize your personal learning by working with industry leaders with previous experience at top companies, this is definitely the place for you.</p>
