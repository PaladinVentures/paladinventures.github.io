            <p class="large">Major: BSc Cognitive System; Masters of Management </p>
            <p class="large">
              We were extremely impressed with Ivanâ€™s design explorations for an online course platform. He did an excellent job visually reimagining how to structure the content to make the whole website better come together and feel more premium. </p>

              We really liked how Ravina was able to present her thoughts cohesively in a visually attractive manner. Her submission not only presented her user research succinctly, but it also did so in an immersive way that helped the reader get into the shoe's of the user.</p>

            <p class="large">
              We also really liked how Jayden's submission went deep on the user needs and tied them back to the mockups he created. It was easy to tell how he arrived at the assumptions he made as he walked through the low-fidelity wireframes, and then seeing the transition to the high-fidelity versions at the end made this experience easy to imagine.</p>

              We really liked how Ravina thought through all the user pain points to simplify the user experience and built trust and a greater sense of community. Her design also thought through how to better optimize readability throughout the website to increase accessibility.</p>
