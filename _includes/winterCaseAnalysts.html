              <p class="large">We were extremely impressed with Taylor's thorough analysis of the B2B influencer market. She did an excellent job making a case for why we should focus on digital marketing management as the initial niche for an influencer platform and provided example businesses who would love to work with the influencers she identified.

              <p class="large">Rebecca did a wonderful job identifying the two sided marketplace of businesses and influencers in our case challenge. She then found a novel domain, <a href="http://www.thoughthub.com/">www.thoughthub.com</a> which was publicly available and could effectively appeal to both audiences we were trying to reach.

              Grace demonstrated a clear understanding of the industry, competitors, and most importantly, the needs and painpoints experienced by a user of this software. Her recommendations were thorough and addressed the overarching strategy but also the minor, yet important modifications to improve the user experience. This included layout changes, planning services, plugin additions, partnership promotions and pre-made templates.</p>

              <p class="large">Overall, we were very impressed with Graceâ€™s ability to envision how the product needs should evolve to meet the growth objectives of the company.
