              Noah's did a thorough analysis of the Orange County market complete with proof of concept's at specific schools. He coupled this with an idea to create a summer immersion experience for students with higher willingness to pay, in addition to our classroom curriculum offering.</p>

              <p class="large">Given that the education market is whale heavy (a small percentage of families have an extremely high willingness to pay which constitutes most of the market), creating a premium summer experience for the “whales” was a great idea to increase revenue.
