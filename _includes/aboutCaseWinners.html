            <p class="large"><strong>Winner: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nethra-jayaprakash-694306195/">Nethra Jayaprakash</strong></a> </p>
            <p class="large">Education: Rutgers University: Honors College & Business School</p>
            <p class="large">Bachelor of Science in Finance and Political Science</p>
              <p class="large"> We were extremely impressed with Nethra's thorough analysis of the DTC market for luxury towels. She did an excellent job making a case for why we should focus on introducing a "touch" factor with the brand, building a strong fan base to help grow the community (using TikTok), and partnering with the right suppliers to get the perfect material (her deep dive on suppliers helped us lock in a partner and provided insights into the manufacturing process).
